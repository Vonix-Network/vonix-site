1. && does not work for multiple commands, try semicolon
2. always commit and push edits
3. Always use best practices for code quality and the application you are working on
4. Always build and check for type errors before commits (npm run build --stacktrace & npx tsc)
5. Build with optimization and speed in mind
6. Build with resource usage in mind
7. Avoid creating a bunch of .md and .txt files, there should be only one changelog and it should be updated with each change and you should come up with version numbers, starting with 3.0.0
